### Welcome to
# **App a Day!**

**App a Day!** is a new way for beginning coders to enter a calm and friendly atmosphere to start learning the fundamentals of coding. By taking small functional pieces of code and breaking them down line by line after being replicated we hope to give users an easily digestible set of tools to grow as programmer. We understand the difficulties of learning programing and how daunting at times it can be to try and learn something new, and we hope to provide a comfortable atmosphere for all those looking to improve their coding skills!

The app can be accessed here.

### HOW TO USE:

To gain access to all of our website, we use a quick 2 click login process, accessed at the top right of our app:

[INSERT PIC 1]

From there you are now allowed to check out our recommended list of video tutorials, engage in new lessons, and provide feedback to help us better our site. Just click any of the links at the top of the navigation bar and you’re ready to roll!

In the `video tutorials` section is a quick place to jump to allow users to brush up on their javascript visually should they so desire. We at App a Day believe learning comes in all fashions, and feel that video tutorials are one of the most engaging and popular forms of study today.

In the `additional resources` section we’ve created an online comment board for public input, and the free code section is there for those wishing to make use of the Stackblitz extension.

### HOW TO INSTALL:

If you're accessing this apps code the instructions to run it are as follows:
    
    > npm install && npm run client-install
    > npm run dev
   
   The website should pop open a few moments after and you're ready to learn!

### MVP

- Allow users the ability to engage in basic javascript lessons provided in an easily understandable format.

- Give users the chance to provide feedback allowing for growth of the application itself.

- Provide alternative outlets for learning in a single app

### FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

In the future, our team would love to implement multiple ideas, most notably a proper lesson system in which a user clicks a specific lesson, and a proper stackblitz and carousel instance display relevant information about whatever lesson was clicked.

We were very interested in creating an environment in which a user could fully immerse themselves into this subject, without much need to have other website tabs and the like open, so we would be open into researching and implementing new styles of web learning into our app.
